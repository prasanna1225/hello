I am installing usefull softwares for your system 
1 icecream screen recorder for online classess recording
2 winrar for compressed file formats will not see directly
3 utorrent is used for downloading any meterial from internet if internet gone and came after sometime it will autometically download your files
4 ccleaner for system freeness(it means if system hangings and long time batery stand and better ferformance )


**************************
We should do some manual commands run on this system every week or month to perform better performance


1 press Windows symbol + R
or 
open command prompt

		> temp
		> %temp%
		> prefetch
		> recent
		> tree

These are mandatory tools to increase system performance

after that run ccleaner to clear unwanted cookies and virus threads
